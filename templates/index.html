<p style="text-align: center;">
Thank you for applying for membership with the Students’ Cooperative Association. We accept
applications from students and non-students (18+). Priority goes to students, but non-students
are welcome to apply and will be considered based on student to non-student ratios in their
house of interest. This application is an important part of the membership process, but it is not
the only factor considered for membership. If you are in the Eugene area, you can get to know
us by stopping by and hanging out after communicating with a member of the house of your
interest to see if the cooperative lifestyle is right for you. If you’re not in the area but still want
to get to know us, we can arrange a phone/zoom interview to accommodate your needs.
COVID-19 Note: Since COVID-19, we no longer accept drop-by visits. If you would like to get
to know us better, consider alternative options to get to know the co-ops; such as applying to
be a boarder, scheduling a meet up in advance, or scheduling a video call.<br>
<b>OBTAINING, FILLING OUT, AND TURNING IN THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT
GUARANTEE MEMBERSHIP TO, OR FOR THE SCA.</b><br>
The membership coordinator will confirm receipt of your application within two weeks. If you
have not heard from us by that time, please call or email to ensure we have received it.
Applicants will be considered for membership as openings occur; we do not have specific
application deadlines. When there are no current openings, we will keep applications in a pool
for up to one year. Applicants will be evaluated according to the following criteria:<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Interest in the cooperative life and ability to work in a cooperative manner
    </li>
    <li>
        Involvement in their community or school
    </li>
    <li>
        Personal references
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
Membership Diversity and other house-specific needs may be taken into consideration.<br>
If you have any questions or need help filling out this application, please contact us at
sca.weownit@gmail.com. In addition, we have a google form application available at this link
if the pdf version proves a barrier to you. Just make sure to let the office know you intend to
submit your application that way. https://forms.gle/P1grduxCA2j3MGtN8<br>
